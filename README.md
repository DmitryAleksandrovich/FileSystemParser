# File System Parser

Simple file system parser. This program reads the directory tree and it can to search files by name or part of the name.
I used design pattern Composite for the tree structure. I used smart pointer "shared_ptr" for storing pointers to component in conteiner (vector).
The program simulates the DOS command "CD" and "DIR".
